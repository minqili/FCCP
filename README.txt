This package contains our implementation for:
 "Fast non-rigid points registration with cluster correspondences projection".
===========================================================================

*** The code is run on MATLAB R2014a-2018a on Windows 10 64 bit.

Only used for demo. 
Parts of the codes are encrypted. Full codes will be released later.

Usage:

>>run 'FCCP_registration_demo2D.m'  %2d points registration. 

>>run 'FCCP_registration_demo3D.m'  %3d points registration. 

Notice:
The codes have not been optimized, and only used for demo.
